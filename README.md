# Vehicle Light Signal (VLS) Dataset Information


Our Vehicle Light Signal (VLS) dataset contains 4 common behaviours of vehicles: driving forward, braking, turning left, turning right. Each behaviour signal contains 2 classes: day and night, since the lighting signals are not the same when during the day and night. The specific label categories are as follows:

1.day_forward

2.day_brake

3.day_left

4.day_right

5.night_forward

6.night_brake

7.night_left

8.night_right

Totally, this dataset includes 7720 images, 9 categories (including background), and 10571 instances. The data distribution statistics can be viewed at following histogram:
